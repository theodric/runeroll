Please write a program in Python 3 to cast 9 randomly selected runes, using the list we just employed, onto a surface which is labeled with the directions of the compass (N, NNE, NE, ENE, E, ESE, SE, SSE, S, SSW, SW, WSW, W, WNW, NW, NNW). Each rune should be cast individually, and its position on the surface should be determined via random chance. Additionally, each rune has the possibility of landing face down or face up. The program should display the name of each rune that is cast, but should note which runes land face down and which land face up. Represent the output of this process graphically using matplotlib.

Please write a program in Python 3 to cast 9 randomly selected runes from this list: Kaunan, Thurisaz, Haglaz, Mannaz, Sowilō, Raido, Ansuz, Wunjô, Tiwaz, Algiz, Laguz, Gyfu, Jēran, Ehwaz, Ingwaz, Othala, Oss, Kauna, Urr, Yngvi. Cast the runes onto a surface which is labeled with the directions of the compass arranged in a circle. The directions, starting at the top and proceeding clockwise are: N, NNE, NE, ENE, E, ESE, SE, SSE, S, SSW, SW, WSW, W, WNW, NW, NNW. Each rune should be cast individually, and its position on the surface should be determined via random chance. Additionally, each rune has the possibility of landing face down or face up. The program should display the name of each rune that is cast, but should note which runes land face down and which land face up. Represent the output of this process with vector graphics, for example using the pygame library.
